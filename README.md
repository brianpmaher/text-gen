# Markov-Chain text generator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain

A rough Markov-Chain text generator I created to parse some WhatsApp group conversations.  Just done for some practice with the algorithm.  Not very flexible or reusible since a lot of the adjustment was hard-coded for the sake of playing around with the algorithm.
